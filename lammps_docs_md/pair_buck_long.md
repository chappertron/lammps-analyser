# pair_style buck/long/coul/long command

Accelerator Variants: *buck/long/coul/long/omp*

## Syntax

``` LAMMPS
pair_style buck/long/coul/long flag_buck flag_coul cutoff (cutoff2)
```

-   flag_buck = *long* or *cut*

        *long* = use Kspace long-range summation for the dispersion term 1/r\^6
        *cut* = use a cutoff

-   flag_coul = *long* or *off*

        *long* = use Kspace long-range summation for the Coulombic term 1/r
        *off* = omit the Coulombic term

-   cutoff = global cutoff for Buckingham (and Coulombic if only 1
    cutoff) (distance units)

-   cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units)

## Examples

``` LAMMPS
pair_style buck/long/coul/long cut off 2.5
pair_style buck/long/coul/long cut long 2.5 4.0
pair_style buck/long/coul/long long long 4.0
pair_coeff * * 1 1
pair_coeff 1 1 1 3 4
```

## Description

The *buck/long/coul/long* style computes a Buckingham potential (exp/6
instead of Lennard-Jones 12/6) and Coulombic potential, given by

$$\begin{aligned}
E = & A e^{-r / \rho} - \frac{C}{r^6} \qquad r < r_c \\
E = & \frac{C q_i q_j}{\epsilon  r} \qquad r < r_c
\end{aligned}$$

$r_c$ is the cutoff. If one cutoff is specified in the pair_style
command, it is used for both the Buckingham and Coulombic terms. If two
cutoffs are specified, they are used as cutoffs for the Buckingham and
Coulombic terms respectively.

The purpose of this pair style is to capture long-range interactions
resulting from both attractive 1/r\^6 Buckingham and Coulombic 1/r
interactions. This is done by use of the *flag_buck* and *flag_coul*
settings. The [Ismail](Ismail) paper has more details on when it is
appropriate to include long-range 1/r\^6 interactions, using this
potential.

If *flag_buck* is set to *long*, no cutoff is used on the Buckingham
1/r\^6 dispersion term. The long-range portion can be calculated by
using the [kspace_style ewald/disp or pppm/disp](kspace_style) commands.
The specified Buckingham cutoff then determines which portion of the
Buckingham interactions are computed directly by the pair potential
versus which part is computed in reciprocal space via the Kspace style.
If *flag_buck* is set to *cut*, the Buckingham interactions are simply
cutoff, as with [pair_style buck](pair_buck).

If *flag_coul* is set to *long*, no cutoff is used on the Coulombic
interactions. The long-range portion can calculated by using any of
several [kspace_style](kspace_style) command options such as *pppm* or
*ewald*. Note that if *flag_buck* is also set to long, then the
*ewald/disp* or *pppm/disp* Kspace style needs to be used to perform the
long-range calculations for both the Buckingham and Coulombic
interactions. If *flag_coul* is set to *off*, Coulombic interactions are
not computed.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms types
via the [pair_coeff](pair_coeff) command as in the examples above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the [read_data](read_data) or
[read_restart](read_restart) commands:

-   A (energy units)
-   rho (distance units)
-   C (energy-distance\^6 units)
-   cutoff (distance units)
-   cutoff2 (distance units)

The second coefficient, rho, must be greater than zero.

The latter 2 coefficients are optional. If not specified, the global
Buckingham and Coulombic cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are
used. If only one cutoff is specified, it is used as the cutoff for both
Buckingham and Coulombic interactions for this type pair. If both
coefficients are specified, they are used as the Buckingham and
Coulombic cutoffs for this type pair. Note that if you are using
*flag_buck* set to *long*, you cannot specify a Buckingham cutoff for an
atom type pair, since only one global Buckingham cutoff is allowed.
Similarly, if you are using *flag_coul* set to *long*, you cannot
specify a Coulombic cutoff for an atom type pair, since only one global
Coulombic cutoff is allowed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Styles with a *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the [Accelerator packages](Speed_packages)
page. The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce
the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, INTEL, KOKKOS, OPENMP, and
OPT packages, respectively. They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built
with those packages. See the [Build package](Build_package) page for
more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the [-suffix command-line
switch](Run_options) when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
[suffix](suffix) command in your input script.

See the [Accelerator packages](Speed_packages) page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

## Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info

This pair style does not support mixing. Thus, coefficients for all I,J
pairs must be specified explicitly.

This pair style supports the [pair_modify](pair_modify) shift option for
the energy of the exp() and 1/r\^6 portion of the pair interaction,
assuming *flag_buck* is *cut*.

This pair style does not support the [pair_modify](pair_modify) shift
option for the energy of the Buckingham portion of the pair interaction.

This pair style supports the [pair_modify](pair_modify) table and
table/disp options since they can tabulate the short-range portion of
the long-range Coulombic and dispersion interactions.

This pair style write its information to [binary restart
files](restart), so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need to be
specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style supports the use of the *inner*, *middle*, and *outer*
keywords of the [run_style respa](run_style) command, meaning the
pairwise forces can be partitioned by distance at different levels of
the rRESPA hierarchy. See the [run_style](run_style) command for
details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Restrictions

This style is part of the KSPACE package. It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package. See the [Build package](Build_package) page
for more info.
